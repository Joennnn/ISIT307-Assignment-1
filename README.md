SIM-UOW ISIT307 Web Server Programming Assignment 1

## Description
This assignment is to create an interactive website by using web forms,
manipulating strings and arrays, and validating/handling user input and text files (for 
storing and retrieving information).

## Getting Started
Make sure you have [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/download-wampserver-64bits/) installed. 

Once you have XAMPP or WAMP installed, run it and change the settings to allow links on project homepage to easily access the files.
Ensure that you move the files to either your XAMPP ```C:\xampp\htdocs``` or WAMP ```C:\wamp\www``` file directory.

After installation and setting of the settings, open your web browser and type in localhost.
